# ACSE
ACSE is a new method of modding planet coaster, initially created for Jurassic World Evolution by the OpenNaja team, I ported it to work with Planet Coaster.
It's essentially a new mod loading method that opens wide modding possabilities for developers, and makes installing easier for end users.
It's important to note ACSE is not a replacement for the old mod manager, but rather a seperate method, I eventually hope to port over all mods to this new method, but more development time is needed until then, for now this functions as an alpha release, which will hopefully be expanded upon with a proper mod manager at some point.
ACSE is specifically a code loader, but I will generally refer to "ACSE mods" as anything that uses a new content pack to load in mods.

I'm sorry this took so long, it was originally going to be a bigger release but school has caught up to me and other factors have meant this wasn't how I originally planned, but it's still an exciting development and a new era for planet coaster modding.

# SmoothingMod+
The much anticipated smoothing mod changes the functionality of the old smoothing buttons to have 4 new options
* Smooth
* Smooth Forward
* Smooth Backward
* Smooth Burst

I hope these are self-explanatory as they have been demo'd in previous videos

# SmootherCameraMod
This was also previewed in a previous update, and removed the wobbly camera effect that was pre programmed into the game's coasters.
This essentially adds in the camera from the aces sky coaster to all coasters, Thanks again to Theme Park Wirral for discovering this feature which has allowed me to impliment it into a mod.
